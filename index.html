    <h2> ABOUT </h2>
    <p id="blurb">
      Thanks for stopping by! My name is Yoona Oh, and I'm a junior at Rice studying
      Computer Science and Cognitive Science.

      I like learning about people, and I like building and playing with technology.
      I am looking for opportunities that will let me do both.

      My ultimate goal is to create meaningful experiences for people. I want to make things that will
      highlight and celebrate the beauty of being human and our connections to each other.

      When I'm not coding or designing experiences, I twirl baton(s), dance, swim,
      craft, read webtoons, and consume matcha lattes and bubble tea.

            <h2> Motivation </h2>
              <p>
                Language exposure during infancy is important for healthy social, emotional, and cognitive <br>
                development. However, deaf children of hearing parents often don't get this exposure due to <br>
                a mismatch in communication modalities between the parent, who primarily uses spoken language,<br>
                and the child, who doesn't have access to that language.
              </p>
            <h2> Process </h2>
              <p>
                Hardware: Portable projector, desk device clamp, laptop computer hosting interface <br>

              <p>
                I like to journal every day, and I like using a computer to do so. <br>
                I wanted to make a web-based journaling application that can remind people <br>
                to journal daily because it leads to better writing skills, mental health, <br>
                and productivity. Plus, it's great to look back on little moments throughout <br>
                your life.

            <h1> Pretty Pictures </h1>
            <p> November 2018 </p>
            <h2> Motivation </h2>
              <p> Final project for Intro to Program Design course (COMP 215) <br>
                Implemented a genetic algorithm and deployed a web microservice for <br>
                generating pretty, as defined by the user, computer graphics and images using Java
              </p>
            <h2> Process </h2>
              <p>
                Each computer graphic was generated through a series of arithmetic operations on rgb color <br>
                values and external image files, which were then formatted into JSON for parsing and reading. <br>
                Through ApacheSpark and JavaScript, the user is given an interface that allows them to choose <br>
                2 or more default images for crossbreeding and mutation, thus producing prettier children images <br>
                with each generation.
              </p>
            <h2> Product </h2>
              <p> The interface and some pretty pictures I was able to make with it.</p>

            <p> 9/14/18 - 9/16/18 </p>
            <h2> Motivation </h2>
              <p>
                HackRice 8.0 had a Design Track that challenged hackers to redesign the UI of an application.<br>
                My teammates, Esther Plants and Varsha Veer, and I decided to redesign the scheduling tool When2Meet.<br>
                When2Meet is a popular schedule coordination tool with Rice organizations; however, its unintuitive, <br>
                clunky interface makes first-time users frustrated. So, we set out to develop a cleaner, simpler interface <br>
                with some additional features that could make When2Meet more appealing.
              </p>
            <h2> Process </h2>
              <p>
                I acted as team lead since my teammates did not have extensive experience in web development. We brainstormed <br>
                and designed together, and my main role in development was creating the personal and group availability pages.

            <h2> Motivation </h2>
              <p>
                Final project for the Google Computer Science Summer Institute. My friends <br>
                Delali Azamati and Emmanuel Honore developed a website to aid applicants <br>
                during the college admissions process. We were all members of College Access Programs, <br>
                so we wanted to provide a resource for low-income and first generation students trying <br>
                to navigate college applications.
              </p>
            <h2> Process </h2>
              <p>
                I primarily worked on front-end for the registration, user dashboard, and testing page and back-end.
